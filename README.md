# linux
My public utility scripts for linux
I used some of theses scripts as documention for my web server.



--Changes 2026.FEB.8.02:02--
Slowed down web_full due to problems of setting up front parts of the scripts before any async cmds where finished
(caddy and the systemctl start)

Added reinitalise.sh, this update the linix-public and uninstalls and reinstalls the web server instances :)
